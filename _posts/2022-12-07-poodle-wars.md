[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) is the latest AI conversational model based on GPT 3.5 from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). You can try it [here](https://chat.openai.com/).

ChatGPT responds to its prompts almost instantly, so the conversational flow is absurdly smooth. 

At the beginning of the exchange that follows, I've tried to share a sense of the back-and-forth. Toward the end I iterated my prompts a bit in order to show just how far the engine can be pushed.

All of it is an EXACT copy-and-paste from ChatGPT. I have edited NOTHING.

Draw your own conclusions.

> It has been far too long since we last saw each other. I think about you every day and long for the time when we can be reunited.

>
> But then, something went wrong. I was captured and imprisoned, forced to live a life of loneliness and isolation. I never forgot about you, Snickers. I always knew you were out there somewhere, fighting for our cause.
>
> Now, I am free once again. And I will stop at nothing to find you and reunite with you. I know we can pick up where we left off and continue the fight together.
>
> Please, Snickers, if you are reading this, find a way to get in touch with me. I need you, my love. I need you by my side.
