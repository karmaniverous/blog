Today was a _big_ day for me. After a solid month of work, I completed the Typescript refactor of [`entity-manager`](https://github.com/karmaniverous/entity-manager) and its supporting libraries! All tests are passing and the new major release is now [live on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@karmaniverous/entity-manager).

But... **we're all professionals here, right?** And we all know there's often quite a gap between what gets posted to social media and the reality on the ground.

**So what does _code complete_ actually _mean?_**

## Eating My Own Dog Food

`entity-manager` encapsulates the [single-page design pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/creating-a-single-table-design-with-amazon-dynamodb/) for [NoSQL databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL). It is:

- **Configuration-driven.** You define your data schema and indexing strategy in a config object. All the specially formatted data elements required to _implement_ your config are generated & managed for you under the hood.

- **Massively scalable.** [Partition sharding](https://medium.com/@_amanarora/partitioning-sharding-choosing-the-right-scaling-method-dbc6b2bec1d5) is part of your config. Your sharding strategy can scale with your data, and you can query a hundred million records in parallel over four indexes across 32 partition shards with the same command that queries one index on a single partition.

- **Provider-agnostic.** The underlying database query is an [injected dependency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection), so while I built `entity-manager` for [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/dynamodb), you could run it against any NoSQL database engine.

- **Type-safe.** If you use Typescript, it is nearly impossible to create an invalid configuration. If you don't, the library will still catch most config errors at runtime (thanks [`zod`](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod)!).

Now why would I do all that?

At my real job, I'm building a massively scalable product with a complex data model that is (at last count) spread across 16 distinct back-end services, each with its own DynamoDB data store. If I had built [VeteranCrowd](https://veterancrowd.com) without a dependency like `entity-manager` in place, we would now have a dangerously fragmented code base and would be facing a complete rebuild as the application scales.

So I built `entity-manager` because I needed it. And I built it as a hyper-generic, open-source library because I've learned the hard way that there's a clear difference between building a thing to solve a problem, and building a thing to solve a _category_ of problems.

When you create a generic solution to an entire category of problems, you don't just build the thing differently. **_You build a different thing._**
{: .notice--info}

My initial implementation of the VeteranCrowd back end was in Javascript, so early verions of `entity-manager` followed suit.

But early on we refactored our front end into Typescript, and the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/) underlying our back end has shifted to Typescript-first with [version 4](https://www.serverless.com/blog/serverless-framework-v4-general-availability). So like it or not (and I _do_ like it), our back end will be moving to Typescript soon enough.

If we're going to do that right, our key back-end dependencies need to be [type-safe](https://dev.to/mistval/type-safe-typescript-4a6f). And I'm now sitting on two years' worth of lessons learned from operating the VeteranCrowd back end in production. Since `entity-manager` is about as key as key dependencies get, it seemed like the right place to start.

So I rebuilt `entity-manager` from the ground up in Typescript.

And even though VeteranCrowd's back end is still a Javascript implementation, I can import the new version of `entity-manager` _immediately_‚Äîwith just a minimal refactor‚Äîin order to take advantage of its simplified configuration and significant performance enhancements.

That's a win!

## The Documentation Gap

If you wanted to explore the [`entity-manager` repo](https://github.com/karmaniverous/entity-manager) right now, there'd be good news and bad news.

The good news is that it _works_. If you want to manage & query NoSQL data at scale, `entity-manager` is a solid choice.

Also, thanks to [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/), the `entity-manager` API is reasonably well-documented. My [build process](https://github.com/karmaniverous/npm-package-template-ts) generates a very nice [API reference](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/) directly from the Typescript source code, so if you don't mind doing a little digging, you could probably get yourself up and running without too much trouble.

The bad news is that there's a whole layer of _conceptual_ documentation that as yet just doesn't exist.

In order to use `entity-manager` effectively, you need to understand:

- The [single-page design pattern](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/creating-a-single-table-design-with-amazon-dynamodb/)

- Partition sharding strategies and how to [configure](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/interfaces/index.ShardBump.html) them.

- How to define an [Entity](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/types/index.ConfigEntity.html)

- How to define [generated properties](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/types/index.ConfigEntityGenerated.html) & indexes

- [Transcodes](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/types/index.Transcodes-1.html) and how to connect them to generated property & index elements

- How to write a [ShardQueryFunction](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/types/index.ShardQueryFunction.html) & pass it to the [`EntityManager`](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/classes/index.EntityManager.html) class

- How to [add generated keys](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/classes/index.EntityManager.html#addKeys) to your data items & [remove them](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/classes/index.EntityManager.html#removeKeys).

- How to [query your data](https://karmanivero.us/entity-manager/classes/index.EntityManager.html#query).

If you followed any of those links, you're rolling your eyes right now. ü§£

I built `entity-manager`, so of course I know how to use it. And, truthfully, using it is pretty straightforward... _once you know how_.

**‚≠ê Everything's easy once you know how!**
{: .notice--info}

In order to get there, you're going to need _real_ documentation, with explanations in English, examples in code, and diagrams to help you understand the concepts. **_Lots_ of diagrams.**

Without that documentation‚Äîand, critically, without all those pictures‚Äîthere isn't a chance in the world that anybody but me is ever actually going to use `entity-manager`.

So that's what comes next: I need to write the book on `entity-manager`.

Now... **_just wait a minute!_**

A _product_ is something people will pay money for, right? And so far the only actual product we've discussed here is VeteranCrowd. If VeteranCrowd is the product, then I already have everything I need, don't I?

I do very much live in the open-source world, and `entity-manager` is a very useful open-source tool. I'm proud of it... but it's _not_ a product. Spending another month writing `entity-manager` documentation is hardly going to pay my beer tab.

I don't work this hard for free. **So what's the actual product?**

## Still Not The Product

Thanks to tools like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/lambda), DynamoDB, and the Serverless Framework, a competent developer with a running start can put a working, data-enabled API into production in about thirty-seven seconds, give or take.

That's the good news.

The bad news is that **a working, data-enabled API is not an _application_.**

Real serverless applications have _lots_ of moving parts, including:

- Multiple back-end services that can securely talk to the front end and each other.

- A rational authentication scheme that works across all services.

- A service layer that does all the things required by _every_ service, in a consistent way (hello `entity-manager`!).

- Coherent architectural & design patterns that unify all those services so they can be managed with a single set of tools.

- An infrastructure that can move all the parts from development through test and into production with a maximum of automation and a minumum of fuss.

**_... at scale!_**

A couple of years ago I published a Javascript-based [AWS API Template](/blog/aws-api-template/). This was an attempt to bring all these parts together into a template for a real serverless application, and I used it as the starting point for the VeteranCrowd back end.

Two years of build & production across 16 services have taught me a _lot_.

Some of it, naturally, is application-specific, and clearly there is no percentage in sharing my employer's secrets.

But most of the really big lessons I've learned in the last couple of years would apply equally well to _any_ real-world, massively scalable serverless application. And as I've learned these lessons, I've been careful to organize them into hyper-generic, open-source libraries like `entity-manager`.

**‚≠ê You haven't _really_ learned a lesson until you've encapsulated it in code.**
{: .notice--info}

So... **_what's the product?_**

Once I complete & document Typescript refactors of my remaining key dependencies, I will be in a position to publish a new version of the AWS API Template that...

- Is implemented entirely in Typescript.

- Leverages libraries like `entity-manager` that encapsulate highly opinionated, battle-tested approaches to all the hard things.

- Solves the infrastructure problem in a detailed, opinionated way, right out of the box.

- Is _fully documented_ with conceptual explanations, code examples, and diagrams.

Super useful, right? A robust head-start for any organization that wants to build a complex, massively-scalable serverless application in the real world, **at a savings of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars** in development costs.

And totally open source! So... **_still not the product!_**

## The Actual Product

That refactored AWS API Template is going to be a bit of a monster. It will take some time to put together. And I _do_ work for a living!

But **my deal with my employers is always the same**: in order to build your thing as fast as possible and at the highest possible quality, as a matter of principle I build it out of highly generic parts.

The _product_ and its _configuration_ belong to my employer. The _parts_ belong to me... and, since I always open-source them, they belong to everybody.

**Everybody wins.**

All those parts will be well-documented, and the template as a whole will _also_ be well-documented, but there's going to be a lot of territory to cover. Even with the best documentation in the world, it'll be awfully helpful to have a native guide.

That's me.

Twenty years ago, I would have announced that I'm writing a book. But today, I'm not writing a book. **I'm writing a _course_.**

The course will be a series of video lectures presenting the AWS API Template in detail, from the ground up, and drawing heavily on the documentation I had to write anyway. **The goal will be to get a developer up & running with a working API and supporting infrastructure in just a few hours**, with a clear understanding of the template, the underlying concepts, and everything happening under the hood.

I'll sell the course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) or a similar platform, and the price tag will be a nice payoff for me but **an orders-of-magnitude win** for any organization that is serious about building a serverless application in the real world.

**THAT is the product.**

Expect the course to be available within the next few months. I'll be sure to post updates here as the effort proceeds.

Meanwhile, if you're building a serious serverless application _now_ and don't want to wait months to take my course, [get in touch](https://calendly.com/karmaniverous)!

The parts are all there, they're battle-tested, and I'm always happy to help.
