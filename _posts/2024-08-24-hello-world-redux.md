We've been here [before](/blog/hello-again-world).

You know how implementation tends to outstrip documentation. I thought I had the problem licked when I switched to a Jekyll/GitHub Pages blog. Things that are easy tend to be the ones that get done, right?

But there are so MANY platforms. And I really like posting in short form on X. So once I got out of the habit... well, I was out of the habit.

So now we have the lexical equivalent of a fragmented code base: I've got SO many projects, with SO much documentation, that even though I really don't post much in long form any more, I still need a way to bring all that stuff together in one place.

Last week I was patching up my [TypeScript NPM Package Template](https://github.com/karmaniverous/npm-package-template-ts) and, while scratching my head over documenting the API, I ran smack into [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org/). It took a minute to understand that TypeDoc's output will integrate seamlessly with an existing GitHub Pages domain, [like this](https://karmanivero.us/npm-package-template-ts/).

Yah.

Took another minute to realize I needed to upgrade the [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) theme running here, and then suddenly I was back in business with a Partfolio page and a new lease on the bloggerverse!

Not that I expect my HUGE audience (hi, Mom!) to pay much attention to any regular posts here. But I'm going to try hard to say important things here FIRST, unless I have a compelling reason not to.

So let's see where that leads.
