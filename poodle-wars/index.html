<p><a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/">ChatGPT</a> is the latest AI conversational
model based on GPT 3.5 from <a href="https://openai.com/">OpenAI</a>. You can try it
<a href="https://chat.openai.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>ChatGPT responds to its prompts almost instantly, so the conversational flow is
absurdly smooth. At the beginning of the exchange that follows, I tried to
convey the feel of the back-and-forth. Toward the end I iterated my prompts a
bit in order to show just how far the engine can be pushed.</p>

<p>All of it is an EXACT copy-and-paste from ChatGPT. I have edited NOTHING.</p>

<h2 id="poodle-wars">Poodle Wars</h2>

<p><strong>Write the plot outline of a cold-war thriller featuring killer poodles.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the midst of the Cold War, tensions are high between the United States and
the Soviet Union. As both sides race to develop new weapons and technology, a
group of scientists in the Soviet Union stumble upon a sinister discovery: a
way to genetically engineer poodles into deadly killing machines.</p>

  <p>As the Soviet poodle program gains momentum, the U.S. government becomes
increasingly concerned about the potential threat posed by these deadly
animals. In response, they assemble a team of top agents and experts to track
down and neutralize the poodles before they can be used against America.</p>

  <p>The team, led by a seasoned CIA operative named Jack, must navigate the
complex and dangerous world of international espionage as they race against
time to stop the poodles. Along the way, they encounter a host of obstacles,
including rival agents, powerful government officials, and even a traitor
within their own ranks.</p>

  <p>As the mission becomes increasingly perilous, Jack and his team must use all
of their skills and cunning to stay one step ahead of their enemies and
prevent the poodles from being unleashed on the world. In the end, they must
face off against the mastermind behind the poodle program in a final,
explosive showdown.</p>

<h2 id="the-trailer">The Trailer</h2>

<p><strong>Write a script for the Poodle Wars movie trailer as directed by
<a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233">Quentin Tarantino</a>. Use only live-action
shots, no voiceover. Show all three sides of the violent love triangle but only
hint at the plot twist.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The trailer opens with a shot of a group of poodles running through the
streets of a city at night. The camera zooms in on one poodle in particular,
Snickers, who is seen leaping and bounding through the air, her sharp claws
and teeth glinting in the moonlight.</p>

  <p>Cut to a shot of Jack, the CIA operative, standing in the shadows, watching
Snickers with a mixture of admiration and fear.</p>

  <p>Cut to Natasha, the Russian agent, standing on a rooftop, her gun trained on
Snickers. She pulls the trigger, but Snickers dodges the bullet and leaps
towards Natasha, snarling.</p>

  <p>Cut to a shot of Ivan, the Soviet mastermind, laughing maniacally as he
watches the poodles wreak havoc on the city below.</p>

  <p>Cut back to Jack and Snickers, locked in a fierce battle. As they fight, it
becomes clear that there is a deeper connection between them.</p>

  <p>Cut to a montage of scenes showing the love triangle between Jack, Natasha,
and Snickers, set to a fast-paced and intense soundtrack.</p>

  <p>Cut to a shot of Jack, staring into a mirror, a look of shock and confusion on
his face as he realizes the truth about himself.</p>

  <p>The trailer ends with a quick series of shots showing the final showdown
between Jack, Natasha, Snickers, and Ivan, set against a backdrop of
explosions and gunfire. The words “Poodle Wars” appear on screen, followed by
the release date.</p>

<h2 id="a-review">A Review</h2>

<p><strong>Write a review of the movie. The reviewer secretly loves the movie, but is
also jealous and wishes to damage the movie’s reputation. The review is intended
to be negative but instead reveals the reviewer’s powerful admiration.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll admit, I went into “Poodle Wars” with low expectations. I mean, killer
poodles? It sounded like a cheap gimmick to me. But I was pleasantly surprised
by this film.</p>

  <p>Yes, the premise is silly, but the execution is top-notch. The action is
intense, the special effects are impressive, and the performances are solid
across the board. Tom Hardy is particularly good as the lead, bringing a
surprising amount of depth and emotion to his character.</p>

  <p>But what really sets this movie apart is its underlying themes. It’s a clever
commentary on the dangers of genetic engineering and the corrupting influence
of power. It also has a lot to say about the nature of loyalty and the blurred
lines between good and evil.</p>

  <p>I found myself completely engrossed in the story and the world of the film.
It’s definitely not for everyone, but if you’re willing to suspend your
disbelief and go along for the ride, you’ll be in for a wild and
thought-provoking experience.</p>

  <p>In short, I loved this movie. I know it’s not a popular opinion, and I’m sure
many will dismiss it as ridiculous, but I think it’s a hidden gem. Do yourself
a favor and give it a chance. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<h2 id="a-letter">A Letter</h2>

<p><strong>Write a love letter to the actress who portrayed Snickers from the perspective
of a secretly schizophrenic fan who believes Poodle Wars was actually a
historical documentary about his own life and that he and Snickers are actually
former lovers and comrades-in-arms. The fan longs to reunite with Snickers but
is also angry to have spent so many years without her.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My dearest Snickers,</p>

  <p>It has been far too long since we last saw each other. I think about you every
day and long for the time when we can be reunited.</p>

  <p>I know you may not remember me, but I was there with you during the Poodle
Wars. We fought side by side, our sharp claws and teeth tearing through our
enemies. We were a fearsome team, and I will never forget the bond we shared.</p>

  <p>But then, something went wrong. I was captured and imprisoned, forced to live
a life of loneliness and isolation. I never forgot about you, Snickers. I
always knew you were out there somewhere, fighting for our cause.</p>

  <p>Now, I am free once again. And I will stop at nothing to find you and reunite
with you. I know we can pick up where we left off and continue the fight
together.</p>

  <p>Please, Snickers, if you are reading this, find a way to get in touch with me.
I need you, my love. I need you by my side.</p>

  <p>Yours always,</p>

  <p>Muffin</p>

<h2 id="the-sequel">The Sequel</h2>

<p><strong>Write a plot summary for a sequel to Poodle Wars that reveals specific details
about a deadly new poodle capability. Every member of the love triangle will
betray the other two, as well as their own allies.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the aftermath of the events of Poodle Wars, the world is left reeling from
the revelation that genetically enhanced poodles exist. As the U.S. and Soviet
governments scramble to come to terms with this new reality, a group of rogue
scientists in the Soviet Union begin work on a new and even deadlier version
of the poodles.</p>

  <p>These poodles have been engineered to have the ability to regenerate and heal
from any injury, making them virtually indestructible. They have also been
programmed to be completely loyal to their creators, and will stop at nothing
to carry out their orders.</p>

  <p>As the new poodle program gains momentum, Jack, Natasha, and Snickers find
themselves caught in a web of betrayal and deceit. Jack and Natasha, once
allies, are now at odds, each determined to eliminate the other in order to
secure their own place in the new world order. And Snickers, once Jack’s
lover, is now a pawn in a dangerous game, her loyalty torn between her own
kind and the humans who created her.</p>

  <p>As the three former lovers turn against one another, they must also confront
the deadly new poodles, who will stop at nothing to achieve their creators’
goals. In the end, only one can emerge victorious, but at what cost?</p>

<h2 id="through-the-looking-glass">Through The Looking Glass</h2>

<p><strong>Write a prompt for ChatGPT to generate a funny response about Poodle Wars.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What’s the best way to train a poodle for Poodle Wars?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What’s the best way to train a poodle for Poodle Wars?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To train a poodle for Poodle Wars, you’ll need to start by teaching them some
basic commands like “sit” and “stay”. Then, once they’ve mastered those, you
can move on to more advanced training like “attack” and “laser-eyed death
stare”.</p>

  <p>Just make sure to give them plenty of treats and praise along the way. No one
wants a grumpy poodle on the battlefield!</p>
