Some of these are projects I've worked on, and some are super-useful tools I've created. Built for you with ❤️ on Bali!

## VeteranCrowd

VeteranCrowd is a platform that connects U.S. Military Veterans with offers from Merchants.

Under the hood, it is MUCH more: the platform is highly scalable and super generic. Even in its current state, it can validate membership in virtually ANY group and provide offers to them.

## TypeScript NPM Package Template

**Writing great TypeScript is only half the battle!** You also need to instrument it, format it, lint it, test it, bundle it, document it, and publish it!

Getting all of these pieces to work gracefully together is not trivial.

This template puts it all together in a way that just WORKS, right out of the box, so you can focus on your code. It includes fully-configured support for:

✅ **Code authoring** with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).<br>
✅ **Inline documentation** with [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/).<br>
✅ **CLI generation** with [Commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander).<br>
✅ **Code formatting** with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).<br>
✅ **Linting** with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).<br>
✅ **Unit testing** with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) & [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).<br>
✅ **Bundling** with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).<br>
✅ **Publishing** with [ReleaseIt](https://github.com/release-it/release-it).<br>
✅ **Git hooks** with [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook).<br>
✅ **API documentation** generated by [TypeDoc].<br>
✅ **Recommended VS Code extensions** & settings wherever appropriate.<br>

I use this template for all of my Typescript projects, and I keep it up-to-date with the latest tools & best practices. So use it with confidence!
