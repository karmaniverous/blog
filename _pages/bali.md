I came to Bali as a [_digital nomad_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad) in late 2019.

When the COVID epidemic hit, I decided to stay and make a life here. I have a local company and can legally do business in Indonesia.

I speak Bahasa Indonesia well and have a ton of Indonesian contacts, both here on Bali and across Indonesia. I'm also a former U.S. Navy officer & ocean racer, and have helped more than one stranded boat crew marshal local resources to refit an engine in a remote Indonesian anchorage.

**If you're an English or French speaker in trouble in Indonesia, I can probably help!**

Beyond getting you back out to sea, I can help you with:

- **Strategic introductions** to help you do business on Bali or elsewhere in Indonesia.

- **Emergency translation** to help you navigate the local bureaucracy or explain why you think your starter motor is failing.

- **Company formation** to help you establish a legal presence in Indonesia.

- **Deal negotiation** to help you get the best price on your engine overhaul or the best terms on your land lease.

- **Land acquisition** to help you find and acquire the perfect spot for your new villa or resort.

- **Cultural advice** to help you avoid the pitfalls of doing business in a _very_ foreign land.

The best way to reach me immediately is via [WhatsApp](https://wa.me/17737500338)!
