This toolkit is a collection of documents, templates, and guides that will help you get an Agile off the ground and keep it on track.

No generic template is going to capture the unique challenges and specific requirements of _your_ project, but most of the tools here have been through the wringer more than once, and starting even one rung up any ladder is usually _way_ better than starting from scratch!

So use these as a starting point, and if you find them useful or have suggestions of your own, please use one of the contact links on this page & let me know!

## In This Toolkit

- [**A Modern Agile Project Manifesto**](/toolkits/project-governance/a-modern-agile-project-manifesto/) – A battle-tested, all-inclusive starting point for a modern Agile project.

- [**Git Flow By Example: Writing Down Your Version Control Process**](/toolkits/project-governance/git-flow-by-example-writing-down-your-version-control-process/) – If you haven’t written down your project’s version control process in all its unique glory, then you don’t have one!

- [**Turning the Crank: Design as a Mechanical Process**](/toolkits/project-governance/turning-the-crank-design-as-a-mechanical-process/) – What a good design artifact looks like, what they're actually for, and how to use them efficiently to achieve a better outcome for your project.
