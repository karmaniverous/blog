I've generally been underwhelmed by ChatGPT and the like. Fun toy: not much practical use, so far. But this is an exception!

The two kinds of content I create most are blog posts and GitHub repositories. To get the most out of either, you really need a nice image that will show up well as a social media preview. Ideally, the image should work well as a 2:1 header, and should also crop cleanly into a square format, since it will often show up that way on devices.

These images don't NEED to be heavily designed! Readers will see them in the context of your content, so as long as they LOOK like they reflect your content, you're good.

I played around a bit with ChatGPT, and created these two very handy tools:

- [**Post Social Preview**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-FpuhkQvvU-post-social-preview) - Paste in a link to an article or a blog post, and GPT will respond with an appropriate social media image.

- [**Repo Social Preview**](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-aX4T0aYsl-repo-social-preview) - Same thing, only the GPT is looking specifically for a link to a GitHub repo.

In either case, the GPT will review your content as well as any related code to extract meaning & compose an image. Images will be presented in a 2:1 format, but the GPT is smart enough to create images that crop well to square format.

Once you have your image, you can click on it to either fine-tune or download it.

Images will download in `webp` format, and you can use a free online tool like [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/webp-to-png) to convert them efficiently to `png`, `jpg`, or whatever other format you need.

I use these tools a LOT. See the image at the top of this post? That's a ChatGPT creation! ðŸ˜Ž
