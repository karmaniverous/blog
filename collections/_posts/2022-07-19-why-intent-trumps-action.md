I just spent an hour on a motorcycle listening to Tim Ferriss and Matt
Mullenweig
[sit in an tent in Antarctica](https://tim.blog/2022/03/09/matt-mullenweg-antarctica/),
drinking whiskey and waxing philosophical. A point where they disagreed: _do
actions matter more than intent?_

I've thought a lot about this one, and it's never been a satisfying experience.
So imagine my surprise when the right answer just bubbled up and punched me in
the nose.

Ready?

_It depends._

I don't mean to be an asshole. But I _am_ an engineer, and as soon as we trot
out the word _more_ my ears perk up. Because _more_ implies numbers, and numbers
imply we're measuring something. So I start looking for the metric.

So a more correct answer is: _It depends on what you mean by MORE_. You have to
choose a metric. Otherwise _matters more_ is just a meaningless noise.

Let's play with that. Here's a stab at a better question:

_Do actions matter more than intent for getting into Heaven?_

Short answer: I don't know. Moreover, I don't _care_. I'll let somebody else
answer that one.

Here's another:

_Do actions matter more than intent for staying out of jail?_

In most countries there is at least some wiggle room on this one. But in ALL
countries, if you don't do the action, then your intent is never questioned. So
I think we can safely answer _yes_ to this one.

But here's the question I think Tim & Matt were really getting at:

_Do actions matter more than intent in matters of effectiveness?_

Their conversation was about having a positive effect on the world, and Tim's
argument was that a cynical fat-cat who massively supports a worthy issue to
pimp out his social resume has still managed to move the needle way more than
the true believer who devotes his last dollar to the cause. Matt&mdash;who
generally favors intent&mdash;felt compelled to agree.

Here's my insight: _compound interest beats the lottery almost every time._ A
single bold move might move the needle in the right direction, but it will
rarely fully accomplish a non-trivial goal. Checking off a really big box takes
commitment and vision, and in the real world that almost never happens by
accident.

Tim's fat cat will change his giving strategy the moment his incentives change.
He MIGHT see a big cause through to completion... but he probably won't.

On the other hand, that true believer is capable of learning. If his intent is
sincere and his commitment is real, then there is every reason to expect that
his trivial impact of today will become significant tomorrow, perhaps massively
so, especially as fellow travelers&mdash;some of them quite possibly fat
cats&mdash;join him in the scrum.

So, in the _long_ term, intent really does matter more than any individual
action. Not for any airy-fairy hippy-dippy reason, but simply because it is more
effective at actually getting the job done.
