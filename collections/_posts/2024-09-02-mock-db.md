I released a cool little tool today!

I'm currently performing a complete Typescript refactor of my [**Entity Manager**](https://github.com/karmaniverous/entity-manager) project. This package rationalizes data modeling & query in NoSQL database environments, and it is SUPER important to me because it's a core dependency for the entire [VeteranCrowd](https://veterancrowd.com) back end.

There's a whole list of lessons learned to incorporate, as you could imagine after two years of operating against 16 (and counting) back-end services. So plenty of work to do there.

**Entity Manager** works on a [provider model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provider_model). I'm using it against DynamoDB, but it would work against any "sufficiently similar" NoSQL database.

I found myself wanting badly to improve **Entity Manager**'s test suite, and it occurred to me: what I REALLY need is a way to mock DynamoDB's query & scan behavior with local JSON data.

So I built it!

So far [**`mock-db`**](https://github.com/karmaniverous/mock-db) just replicates DynamoDB's scan & query behaviors, which satisfies my immediate needs. Note that I am NOT replicating the DynamoDB API or query language... just generic interfaces like hash, sort, and page keys, which is plenty if you're building a platform-agnostic tool like **Entity Manager**.

I'll add more capabilities as required. If you try the library and like it or would like to see more features, [let me know](https://github.com/karmaniverous/mock-db/discussions)!

Meanwhile, see [the repo](https://github.com/karmaniverous/mock-db) for lots more details.
